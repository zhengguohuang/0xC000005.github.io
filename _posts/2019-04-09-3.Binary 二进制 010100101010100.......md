# CS50笔记3：Binary 二进制 010100101010100......
# Key Terms
- binary 二进制 number system with base 2
- base, 数位 possible values each digit can take
- decimal 十进制 base 10 system
# Overall
Recall that computers represent data in the form of **bits**, which are just values that can be either 0 and 1. In order to perform mathematical calculations with bits, computers use a number system called binary, which is a number system which only uses two digits: 0 and 1.
## Number System
Every number system has a base, which refers to the number of possible values each digit can take. Most people are used to the **decimal number system,** also known as the base 10 system, where digits can be any value from 0 to 9. 
In the decimal system, each digit in a number represents a power of 10. The rightmost digit represents the 1s place (which is 10^1). The digit second from the right is the 10s place (or 101). The next digit over is the 100s place (or 10^2). To compute the value of a number, just multiply the digit in each place by the value of the place, and add the numbers together.

**Binary is a number system with base** where digits can only be 0 to 1. In this system, each place value in a number represents a power of 2. The rightmost digit is still the 1s place (which is 2^0). The next digit over is the 2s place (equal to 2^1). The next digit over is the 4s place (equal to 2^2), and it would continue on: with the 8s place, the 16s place, the 32s place, etc. To compute the value of a binary number, just multiply the digit in each place (either 1 or 0) by the value of the place, and add the numbers together.

So 110 becomes 1x4 + 1x2 + 0x1 = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6.

## Counting in Binary 
**Counting in binary is much like counting in decimal, with the restriction that we’re only allowed to use two digits: 0 and 1.** 
So 0 translated to binary is still 0, and 1 translated to binary is still 1. But since binary doesn’t allow the digit 2, in order to represent 2 in binary we need another binary digit. Thus, the number 10 can be used to represent 2. Since there is a 1 in the 2s place, and a 0 in the 1s place, the value of the number is 2x1 + 0x1 = 2. If 2 in binary is 10, then 3 in binary is 11.
However, to represent the number 4, we’ve once again run out of bits. **In order to represent the number, a third bit is required**, to create a value in the 4s place. 100 therefore is the binary representation of the number 4.
Mathematics that can be performed in the decimal system can also be performed in binary. **Binary numbers can be counted, added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided just like numbers in decimal, and thus can be used by computers in order to execute computations and make calculations.**
